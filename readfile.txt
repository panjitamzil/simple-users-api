Hi, I'll explain some information :
1. Rename file "env" into ".env"

2. How to run this apps. Choose 1 between "Via docker" or "Via terminal" :
- Via Docker :
    1. Install docker on your laptop/pc/device
    2. Run command "docker build -t app ."
    3. Run command "docker run -p 8080:8080 -it app"

- Via Terminal :
    1. Run command "go run cmd/*.go"


3. For documentation, you can see on : https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5627877/TW6wK9Ga
